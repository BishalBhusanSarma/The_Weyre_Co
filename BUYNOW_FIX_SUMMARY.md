# Buy Now Button Fix - Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

The Buy Now button was incorrectly redirecting to `/checkout` (cart checkout page) instead of `/buynow/${productId}` (quick checkout page).

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

Updated the `buyNow` function in **5 files** to redirect to the correct Buy Now page:

1. ✅ `wc/app/page.tsx` - Home page
2. ✅ `wc/app/products/page.tsx` - All products page
3. ✅ `wc/app/products/men/page.tsx` - Men's products page
4. ✅ `wc/app/products/women/page.tsx` - Women's products page
5. ✅ `wc/app/wishlist/page.tsx` - Wishlist page

## 📋 The Fix

**Changed from:**
```typescript
router.push('/checkout')  // ❌ Wrong - cart checkout
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
router.push(`/buynow/${productId}`)  // ✅ Correct - buy now quick checkout
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### When clicking "Buy Now" button:
1. ✅ Redirects to `/buynow/${productId}` (not `/checkout`)
2. ✅ Shows single product with quantity selector
3. ✅ Displays order summary with pricing
4. ✅ "Proceed to Checkout" button goes to `/buynow/${productId}/checkout`
5. ✅ Completes order with billing form and payment

### When clicking "Proceed to Checkout" from Cart:
1. ✅ Redirects to `/checkout` (cart checkout)
2. ✅ Shows all cart items
3. ✅ Displays order summary with pricing
4. ✅ Completes order with billing form and payment

## 🔍 Two Separate Checkout Flows

| Action | Route | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Buy Now** | `/buynow/${productId}` → `/buynow/${productId}/checkout` | Quick single product purchase |
| **Cart Checkout** | `/checkout` | Multiple products from cart |

## ✨ No More Conflicts

- Buy Now products stay separate from cart
- Cart checkout only shows cart items
- Each flow has its own dedicated pages
- No interference between the two systems

## 🧪 Test It

1. Go to any product page
2. Click "Buy Now" button
3. Should see: `/buynow/${productId}` in the URL
4. Should see: Single product with order summary
5. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
6. Should see: `/buynow/${productId}/checkout` in the URL
7. Complete the order

The issue is now fixed! 🎉
