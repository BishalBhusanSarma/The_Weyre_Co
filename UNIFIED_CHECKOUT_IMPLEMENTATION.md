# Unified Checkout Implementation

## Overview
Replaced the separate buy now page with a unified checkout that handles both cart items and single product purchases.

## Benefits

### 1. Code Simplification
- **Before**: 2 separate checkout pages (checkout + buynow)
- **After**: 1 unified checkout page
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier maintenance

### 2. Consistent Experience
- Same UI for all checkouts
- Same pricing flow
- Same coupon system
- Same test mode

### 3. Better UX
- Familiar interface
- No learning curve
- Consistent navigation

## How It Works

### Buy Now Flow
1. User clicks "Buy Now" on any product
2. Product ID and quantity stored in localStorage
3. Redirects to `/checkout`
4. Checkout detects buy now mode
5. Loads single product instead of cart
6. Shows "Quick Checkout" title
7. Processes order for that product only

### Cart Flow
1. User clicks "Checkout" from cart
2. Redirects to `/checkout`
3. Checkout loads cart items
4. Shows "Checkout" title
5. Processes order for all cart items

## Implementation Details

### localStorage Data Structure
```typescript
// Buy Now Mode
localStorage.setItem('buynow_checkout', JSON.stringify({
    productId: 'product-id',
    quantity: 2
}))
```

### Checkout Page Logic
```typescript
// Check for buy now mode
const buyNowData = localStorage.getItem('buynow_checkout')
if (buyNowData) {
    const { productId, quantity } = JSON.parse(buyNowData)
    setBuyNowMode(true)
    // Load product and calculate totals
    localStorage.removeItem('buynow_checkout') // Clean up
}
```

### Order Creation
```typescript
// Create order items based on mode
const orderItems = buyNowMode 
    ? [{
        order_id: order.id,
        product_id: buyNowProduct.id,
        quantity: buyNowQuantity,
        price: buyNowProduct.price
    }]
    : cartItems.map(item => ({
        order_id: order.id,
        product_id: item.product_id,
        quantity: item.quantity,
        price: item.products.price
    }))
```

### Cart Clearing
```typescript
// Only clear cart if not in buy now mode
if (!buyNowMode) {
    await supabase
        .from('cart')
        .delete()
        .eq('user_id', user.id)
}
```
