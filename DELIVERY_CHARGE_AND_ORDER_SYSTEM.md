# Delivery Charge & Order System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented ₹80 delivery charge system with RTO handling for refunds and updated order ID format.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Order ID Format
- **New Format**: `TWC-{12 random alphanumeric characters}`
- **Example**: `TWC-A7K9M2X4P1Q8`
- **TWC** = The Weyre Co (premium branding)
- Updated `generateOrderId()` function

### 2. Delivery Charges (₹80 per order)
- Added to every order at checkout
- Shown as separate line item
- Included in final total
- Applied to both cart checkout and buy now

### 3. RTO (Return to Origin) Handling
- When order status changes to "return_refund":
  - Deduct ₹80 RTO charge from refund amount
  - Update total revenue (subtract order amount)
  - Track RTO charges separately
- RTO charge is a cost to the business

### 4. Special Discount Display
- Delivery charge shown as "Delivery Charge: ₹80"
- For multiple items, charge remains ₹80 (not per item)
- Transparent pricing for customers

### 5. Test Order Placement
- Enabled direct order placement without payment gateway
- For testing purposes only
- Can be toggled with a flag
- Orders created with "pending" payment status

## Database Considerations:

### Orders Table
- `total`: Includes delivery charge
- `delivery_charge`: ₹80 (new field recommended)
- `rto_charge`: ₹80 if refunded (new field recommended)

### Analytics Impact
- Revenue calculations account for delivery charges
- RTO charges tracked separately
- Profit calculations: Revenue - (Product Cost + Delivery Cost + RTO if applicable)

## Implementation Details:

### Checkout Flow
1. Calculate product subtotal
2. Apply product discounts
3. Apply coupon discounts
4. Add ₹80 delivery charge
5. Show final total
6. Create order with all details

### Refund Flow
1. Admin changes status to "return_refund"
2. System calculates refund: Order Total - ₹80 RTO
3. Update revenue: Subtract order amount
4. Track RTO charge as business cost
