### 2. Order Cancellation with 3-Hour Timer
**Location:** `wc/app/orders/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- Orders can be cancelled within 3 hours of placement

- British English spelling for international market appeal

**Note:** To update database content, run this SQL in Supabase:
```sql
-- Update category names
UPDATE categories SET name = 'Jewellery' WHERE name = 'Jewelry';

-- Update product names
UPDATE products SET name = REPLACE(name, 'Jewelry', 'Jewellery');

-- Update product descriptions
UPDATE products SET description = REPLACE(description, 'jewelry', 'jewellery');
UPDATE products SET description = REPLACE(description, 'Jewelry', 'Jewellery');
```

---

### 6. Custom Order ID Format
**Location:** `wc/lib/orderUtils.ts`

**New Format:** `TWC-YYYYMMDD-XXXXX-HHMMSS`

**Example:** `TWC-20241014-47823-143022`

**Components:**
- `TWC` - The Weyre Co. prefix
- `YYYYMMDD` - Order date (20241014 = October 14, 2024)
- `XXXXX` - Random 5-digit number (10000-99999)
- `HHMMSS` - Order time (143022 = 14:30:22)

**Benefits:**
- Professional business format
- Easy to identify order date at a glance
- Unique with random component
- Sortable by date and time
- Brand recognition with TWC prefix

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export function generateOrderId(): string {
    const now = new Date()
    const date = `${year}${month}${day}` // YYYYMMDD
    const random = String(Math.floor(10000 + Math.random() * 90000)) // 5 digits
    const time = `${hours}${minutes}${seconds}` // HHMMSS
    return `TWC-${date}-${random}-${time}`
}
```
