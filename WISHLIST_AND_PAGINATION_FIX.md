# Wishlist and Pagination Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Wishlist Page Enhancement
**File: `wc/app/wishlist/page.tsx`**

- ✅ Now uses the `ProductCard` component for consistent UI across the app
- ✅ Added remove button (X icon) on each product card in wishlist
- ✅ Integrated cart tracking to show "Go to Cart" button if product is already in cart
- ✅ Removed duplicate code and improved state management
- ✅ Fixed Image import issue

**Features:**
- Remove from wishlist with cross button on product card
- Add to cart functionality with popup confirmation
- Buy now functionality
- Consistent styling with other product pages
- Mobile responsive design

### 2. Pagination Fix - All Product Pages
**Files Updated:**
- `wc/app/products/page.tsx`
- `wc/app/products/men/page.tsx`
- `wc/app/products/women/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Initial load: **24 products** (changed from 20/21)
- ✅ Show More button: Loads **12 more products** each time
- ✅ Added "No more products to load" message when all products are displayed
- ✅ Message only shows if there were more than 24 products initially

**Pagination Logic:**
```
Initial: 24 products
Click "Show More": +12 products (36 total)
Click "Show More": +12 products (48 total)
... and so on

When all products displayed:
- Show More button disappears
- "No more products to load" message appears (if total > 24)
```

### 3. ProductCard Component Enhancement
**File: `wc/components/ProductCard.tsx`**

**New Props:**
- `onRemoveFromWishlist?: (product: any, e: React.MouseEvent) => void`
- `showRemoveButton?: boolean`

**Features:**
- Conditional rendering of wishlist heart icon or remove X icon
- Remove button shows red X icon for wishlist page
- Maintains all existing functionality (discount badges, cart status, etc.)

## How It Works

### Wishlist Page
1. User sees all wishlist items as product cards
2. Each card has a red X button in the top-right corner
3. Clicking X removes the item from wishlist
4. Can add to cart or buy now directly from wishlist
5. Shows "Go to Cart" if product is already in cart

### Product Filtering
1. All product pages (All/Men/Women) load 24 products initially
2. Category filters work correctly and reset to 24 products
3. "Show More" button loads 12 additional products
4. When all products are shown:
   - Button disappears
   - "No more products to load" message appears (if applicable)

### Similar Products
- Product detail page shows up to 8 similar products
- Uses same ProductCard component
- No pagination needed (limited set)
