## 3. Shop by Category Section

### Design:
**Minimal Glassmorphism in Black**

  - Backdrop blur (`backdrop-blur-sm`)
  - White border with 20% opacity
  - Hover effects increase opacity and blur

- **Layout**:
  - Responsive grid: 2 columns (mobile), 3 (tablet), 5 (desktop)
  - Square aspect ratio cards

  - Gradient overlay fades in

#### Code Implementation:
```tsx
<Link href={`/products?category=${category.id}`}>
  {/* Glassmorphism background */}
  <div className="bg-black bg-opacity-60 backdrop-blur-sm 
                  border border-white border-opacity-20
                  hover:bg-opacity-70 hover:backdrop-blur-md" />
  
  {/* Category name */}
  <h3 className="text-white group-hover:scale-110" />
  
  {/* Hover underline */}
  <div className="bg-white opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100" />
  
  {/* Gradient overlay */}
  <div className="bg-gradient-to-t from-black opacity-0 
                  group-hover:opacity-40" />
</Link>
```
