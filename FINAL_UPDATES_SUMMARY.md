  - Random prices (₹299-₹499 selling, ₹399-₹699 actual)
  - Random stock (10-60 items)
  - Random gender (men/women/all)
  - 30% chance of being featured
  - 20% chance of being trending

## How to Use the SQL Script

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor
-- It will add 100 products for testing pagination
```

The script uses a CTE (Common Table Expression) to:
1. Get existing category IDs
2. Generate 100 products with random data
3. Assign random categories to each product
4. Insert all products at once
