To help identify which page you're on, we've added colored badges:

### 🔵 Buy Now Product Page (`/buynow/[id]`)

- **URL**: `/buynow/[product-id]`
- **Shows**: Single product with quantity controls
- **Button**: "Proceed to Checkout"

### 🟣 Buy Now Checkout Page (`/buynow/[id]/checkout`)
- **Badge**: Purple "BUY NOW CHECKOUT - Single Product Only"
- **URL**: `/buynow/[product-id]/checkout`
- **Shows**: Single product order summary with payment
- **Button**: "Proceed to Payment"

### 🟢 Cart Checkout Page (`/checkout`)
- **Badge**: Green "CART CHECKOUT - All Cart Items"
- **URL**: `/checkout`
- **Shows**: All cart items with payment
- **Button**: "Proceed to Payment"

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Buy Now takes me to cart"

**Symptoms**:
- Click "Buy Now" button
- See green badge "CART CHECKOUT - All Cart Items"
- See multiple products instead of one

**Possible Causes**:
1. You're clicking "Go to Cart" button by mistake
2. Browser cache issue
3. Old localStorage data

**Solutions**:

#### Solution A: Check Which Button You're Clicking
The ProductCard has two buttons side by side:
- **Left button** (white): Buy Now → Goes to `/buynow/[id]`
- **Right button** (red if in cart): Go to Cart → Goes to `/cart`

Make sure you're clicking the **left button** (Buy Now).

#### Solution B: Clear Browser Cache
```bash
# In browser:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

# Or use keyboard:
- Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
- Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + F5
```

#### Solution C: Clear localStorage
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
localStorage.clear()
// Then refresh the page
```

#### Solution D: Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Issue 2: "I see cart items on Buy Now page"

**Symptoms**:
- URL shows `/buynow/[id]` or `/buynow/[id]/checkout`
- But you see multiple products

**This should NOT happen** with the new implementation.

**Solutions**:
1. Check the colored badge at the top
2. Check the URL in browser address bar
3. Clear browser cache and localStorage
4. Restart dev server

### Issue 3: "Buy Now button doesn't work"

**Symptoms**:
- Click "Buy Now"
- Nothing happens

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Make sure you're logged in
3. Check product has stock
4. Try in incognito mode

## How to Verify It's Working

## Debug Checklist

If Buy Now isn't working, check:

- [ ] URL in address bar matches expected route
- [ ] Colored badge matches expected page
- [ ] Browser console has no errors
- [ ] User is logged in
- [ ] Product has stock available
- [ ] localStorage is not corrupted
- [ ] Next.js cache is clear
- [ ] Dev server is running
- [ ] Clicking correct button (left = Buy Now)

## URL Reference

| Action | Expected URL | Badge Color | Content |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Click "Buy Now" | `/buynow/[id]` | 🔵 Blue | 1 product |
| Click "Proceed to Checkout" (from Buy Now) | `/buynow/[id]/checkout` | 🟣 Purple | 1 product |
| Click "Proceed to Checkout" (from Cart) | `/checkout` | 🟢 Green | All cart items |

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Take a screenshot** showing:
   - The colored badge at the top
   - The URL in address bar
   - The products displayed

2. **Check browser console** (F12):
   - Look for red error messages
   - Copy any error text

3. **Verify the flow**:
   - Start from product page
   - Note each URL you visit
   - Note what you see on each page

4. **Try incognito mode**:
   - Opens fresh browser with no cache
   - No extensions interfering
   - Clean localStorage

## Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Nuclear Option (Clears Everything)
```bash
# Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm run dev
# Then in browser: Clear cache + localStorage
```

### Fix 2: Check Button Position
```
ProductCard buttons (left to right):
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  Buy Now    │  Add/Go Cart│
│  (white)    │  (border)   │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
     ↑              ↑
  This one!    Not this one
```

### Fix 3: Verify Navigation
```javascript
// In browser console, check where Buy Now goes:
console.log(window.location.href)
// Should show: /buynow/[some-id]
// NOT: /checkout
```

## Success Indicators
