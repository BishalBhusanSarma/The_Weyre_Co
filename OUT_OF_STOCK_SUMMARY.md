# Out of Stock - Quick Summary

## ✅ Fixed!

Products that are out of stock now have:

### Visual Changes:
1. 🔴 **Red "Out of Stock" badge** (replaces green discount badge)
2. ⚫ **Gray disabled buttons** (both Buy Now and Add to Cart)
3. 🚫 **"not-allowed" cursor** on hover
4. 📝 **"Out of Stock" text** on buttons (desktop view)

### Functional Changes:
1. ✅ Buttons are disabled (`disabled={true}`)
2. ✅ Clicks are prevented (`e.preventDefault()`)
3. ✅ No hover effects on disabled buttons
4. ✅ Cannot add to cart or buy out of stock items

## Where It Works:
- ✅ Homepage (Trending & Featured)
- ✅ All Products page
- ✅ Men's & Women's pages
- ✅ Wishlist page
- ✅ Product detail page (Similar Products)
- ✅ Search results

## File Changed:
- `wc/components/ProductCard.tsx`

## Test It:
1. Set a product's stock to 0 in admin
2. View that product anywhere
3. Should see red badge and gray disabled buttons
4. Clicking should do nothing

## Before vs After:

### Before:
- ❌ Could click "Buy Now" on out of stock items
- ❌ Could add out of stock items to cart
- ❌ No visual indication of stock status
- ❌ Users would get errors after clicking

### After:
- ✅ Buttons are disabled and gray
- ✅ Red "Out of Stock" badge visible
- ✅ Clear visual feedback
- ✅ Prevents invalid actions upfront

Done! 🎉
