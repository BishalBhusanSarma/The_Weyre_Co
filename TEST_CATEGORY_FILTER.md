# Test Category Filter - Quick Guide

## The Fix
Added an `initialized` flag to prevent loading products before the category is set from the URL.

## Test Steps

### 1. Test Category Filter from Homepage
1. Go to homepage
2. Scroll to "Shop by Category"
3. Click **"Chains"** (or any category)
4. **Expected Result:**
   - URL changes to `/products?category=X`
   - Only chain products are shown
   - "Chains" button is highlighted/active
   - No other products visible

### 2. Test Category Buttons on Products Page
1. On products page, click **"All"** button
2. **Expected:** All products shown
3. Click **"Rings"** button
4. **Expected:** Only ring products shown
5. Click different categories
6. **Expected:** Products filter correctly each time

### 3. Test URL Direct Access
1. Copy a category URL: `/products?category=123`
2. Open in new tab
3. **Expected:** Page loads with that category already filtered

### 4. Test Skeleton Loading
1. Refresh homepage
2. **Expected:** See skeleton loading for:
   - Shop by Category (6 cards)
   - Trending Now (12 cards)
   - Featured Collection (8 cards)

## What Was Wrong Before

**Before:** Products loaded immediately on mount with no category filter, then category was set (too late).

**Now:** Category is set first, then products load with the correct filter.

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Check browser console for errors and verify:
1. Category ID is being passed in URL
2. `selectedCategory` state is being set
3. Products query includes the category filter

The fix ensures proper initialization order, so it should work now! ðŸŽ‰
