# üîÑ Database Update Required!

## Yes, You Need to Update Your Database

The new features require database schema changes. Here's what to do:

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended)

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. **Delete all existing data** (if you don't need it)
3. Copy the entire content from `wc/database.sql`
4. Click "Run"

This creates everything fresh with sample products.

### Option 2: Update Existing Database

If you want to keep your existing data, run this SQL:

```sql
-- Add gender column to products
ALTER TABLE products 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS gender TEXT DEFAULT 'all' CHECK (gender IN ('men', 'women', 'all'));

-- Update existing products
UPDATE products SET gender = 'all' WHERE gender IS NULL;
```
