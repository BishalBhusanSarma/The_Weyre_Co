# Coupon Discount Fix - Checkout & Buy Now

## 🚨 Problems Fixed

### Problem 1: Checkout Page - No Coupon Functionality
**Issue:** Cart checkout page had no coupon input or discount calculation
**Impact:** Customers couldn't apply coupons when checking out from cart

### Problem 2: Coupon Discount Not Subtracted
**Issue:** Even when coupon was applied (Buy Now), the discount wasn't subtracted from the final total sent to payment gateway
**Impact:** Customers were charged full price even with valid coupons

### Problem 3: Currency Symbol Wrong
**Issue:** Checkout page showed `$` instead of `₹`
**Impact:** Confusing for Indian market customers

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Coupon Functionality to Checkout Page
**Location:** `wc/app/checkout/page.tsx`

**Added:**
- Coupon code input field
- Apply/Remove coupon buttons
- Coupon validation logic
- Coupon discount calculation
- Coupon usage tracking
- Error handling

**Features:**
- Same coupon system as Buy Now page
- Validates coupon code
- Checks expiry date
- Checks minimum purchase
- Checks usage limits
- Prevents duplicate usage per user
- Shows applied coupon with green badge
- Displays discount amount

---

### 2. Fixed Discount Calculation
**Both Pages:** `checkout/page.tsx` and `buynow/[id]/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Order total didn't include coupon discount
total: total,  // ❌ Full price
orderAmount: total  // ❌ Full price to payment gateway
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Order total includes coupon discount
const finalTotal = total - couponDiscount
total: finalTotal,  // ✅ Discounted price
orderAmount: finalTotal  // ✅ Discounted price to payment gateway
```

**Result:** Customers now pay the correct discounted amount!

---

### 3. Fixed Currency Symbols
**Location:** `wc/app/checkout/page.tsx`

**Changed:**
- `$` → `₹` (all instances)
- Consistent with rest of website
- Proper Indian market pricing

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Checkout Page Flow
```
1. Customer adds items to cart
2. Goes to checkout
3. Sees coupon input field
4. Enters coupon code (e.g., "SAVE20")
5. Clicks "Apply"
6. System validates:
   - Code exists and is active
   - Not expired
   - Meets minimum purchase
   - Not at usage limit
   - User hasn't used it before
7. If valid:
   - Shows green badge with code
   - Displays discount amount
   - Subtracts from total
8. Customer clicks "Place Order"
9. Order created with:
   - finalTotal = subtotal - couponDiscount
   - coupon_code saved
   - coupon_discount saved
10. Payment gateway receives discounted amount
11. Coupon usage recorded
12. Coupon used_count incremented
```

### Buy Now Page Flow
```
Same as above, but for single product purchase
Already had coupon functionality
Now properly subtracts discount from payment amount
```

## 💰 Discount Calculation

### Product Discount
```typescript
actualPrice = ₹5,999.99 (MRP)
sellingPrice = ₹4,999.99 (Discounted)
productDiscount = ₹1,000.00
```

### Coupon Discount
```typescript
// Percentage coupon (e.g., 10% off)
subtotal = ₹4,999.99
couponValue = 10%
couponDiscount = ₹499.99

// Fixed amount coupon (e.g., ₹500 off)
couponDiscount = ₹500.00

// With max discount cap
couponValue = 20%
calculated = ₹999.99
maxDiscount = ₹500.00
couponDiscount = ₹500.00 (capped)
```

### Final Total
```typescript
finalTotal = subtotal - couponDiscount
finalTotal = ₹4,999.99 - ₹500.00
finalTotal = ₹4,499.99  ← This goes to payment gateway
```

## 🔍 Validation Rules

### Coupon Validation Checks
1. **Code exists** - Must be in database
2. **Is active** - `is_active = true`
3. **Not expired** - `valid_until > now()`
4. **Minimum purchase** - `subtotal >= min_purchase`
5. **Usage limit** - `used_count < usage_limit`
6. **User hasn't used** - Check `coupon_usage` table

### Error Messages
- "Please enter a coupon code"
- "Invalid coupon code"
- "Coupon has expired"
- "Minimum purchase of ₹X required"
- "Coupon usage limit reached"
- "You have already used this coupon"
- "Error applying coupon"

## 📝 Database Updates

### Orders Table
```sql
-- Now properly saves:
total: finalTotal (with coupon discount)
actual_total: original price
discount_amount: product + coupon discounts
coupon_code: applied coupon code
coupon_discount: coupon discount amount
```

### Coupon Usage Table
```sql
-- Records each coupon use:
coupon_id: UUID
user_id: UUID
order_id: UUID
discount_amount: amount saved
created_at: timestamp
```

### Coupons Table
```sql
-- Increments used_count:
used_count = used_count + 1
