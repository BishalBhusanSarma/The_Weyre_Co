# Issue Tracking System - Database-Backed

## ✅ Updates Implemented

### 1. Database Tracking
**New Fields Added to Orders Table:**
- `has_issue` (BOOLEAN) - Tracks if customer reported an issue
- `issue_reported_at` (TIMESTAMP) - When issue was reported

### 2. Gmail Opens in New Tab
- Changed from `window.location.href` to `window.open(url, '_blank')`
- Uses Gmail compose URL instead of mailto
- Better user experience

### 3. Admin Filter Logic Updated
- "Having Issue" tab now shows only orders where `has_issue = true`
- No longer shows all delivered orders within 7 days
- Only shows orders where customer actually clicked the button

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Customer Side Flow

**1. Customer Clicks "Having an Issue?"**
```
Button Click
    ↓
Database Update: has_issue = true
    ↓
Gmail Opens in New Tab
    ↓
Toast: "Gmail opened in new tab..."
    ↓
Order UI Updates
```

**2. Database Update**
```typescript
await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .update({
    has_issue: true,
    issue_reported_at: new Date().toISOString()
  })
  .eq('id', order.id)
```

**3. Gmail Opens**
```typescript
const gmailUrl = `https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&fs=1&to=theweyreco.official@gmail.com&su=${subject}&body=${body}`
window.open(gmailUrl, '_blank')
```

---

### Admin Side Flow

**"Having Issue" Filter**
```
Shows orders where:
- has_issue = true

Does NOT show:
- All delivered orders
- Orders within 7 days automatically
- Orders that haven't reported issues
```

**Filter Logic:**
```typescript
if (statusFilter === 'having_issue') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(order => order.has_issue === true)
}
```

---

## 📊 Database Schema

### New Columns

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders 
ADD COLUMN has_issue BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN issue_reported_at TIMESTAMP;
```

### Field Details

**has_issue:**
- Type: BOOLEAN
- Default: false
- Purpose: Track if customer reported an issue
- Set to: true when customer clicks "Having an Issue?"

**issue_reported_at:**
- Type: TIMESTAMP
- Default: NULL
- Purpose: Track when issue was reported
- Set to: Current timestamp when button clicked

---

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before Update

**Customer:**
```

```
"Having Issue" tab shows:
- All delivered orders within 7 days

ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS issue_reported_at TIMESTAMP;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_orders_has_issue ON orders(has_issue);

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Customer Reports Issue
```
Day 1: Order delivered
Day 3: Customer finds issue
    ↓
Customer clicks "Having an Issue?"
    ↓
Database: has_issue = true, timestamp recorded
    ↓
Gmail opens in new tab
    ↓
Customer writes details, attaches video
    ↓
Sends email
    ↓
Admin sees in "Having Issue" tab
    ↓
Admin processes resolution
```

### Use Case 2: Admin Monitors Issues
```
Admin opens dashboard
    ↓
Clicks "Having Issue" tab
    ↓
Sees 3 orders with issues
    ↓
All have has_issue = true
    ↓
Sorted by report time
    ↓
Processes each one
    ↓
Clear action list
```

### Use Case 3: Analytics
```
Query database:
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_issues,
  DATE(issue_reported_at) as report_date
FROM orders
WHERE has_issue = true
GROUP BY DATE(issue_reported_at)

Result: Track issue trends over time
```

## 🔄 Comparison

### Before vs After

**Filter Logic:**

**Before:**
```typescript
// Showed all delivered orders within 7 days
if (statusFilter === 'having_issue') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(order => {
    return order.delivery_status === 'delivered' 
      && daysSinceDelivery <= 7
  })
}
```
❌ Shows orders that don't have issues
❌ Cluttered list
❌ No tracking

**After:**
```typescript
// Shows only orders where customer reported issue
if (statusFilter === 'having_issue') {
  filtered = filtered.filter(order => 
    order.has_issue === true
  )
}
```
✅ Shows only actual issues
✅ Clean list
✅ Database tracked

---

**Gmail Opening:**

**Before:**
```typescript
window.location.href = mailtoLink
```
❌ Redirects current tab
❌ Loses website context
❌ Depends on email client

**After:**
```typescript
window.open(gmailUrl, '_blank')
```
✅ Opens new tab
✅ Keeps website open
✅ Uses Gmail directly

---

## 📊 Database Queries

### Find All Issues

SELECT 
  id,
  user_id,
  has_issue,
  issue_reported_at,
  delivery_status
FROM orders
WHERE has_issue = true
ORDER BY issue_reported_at DESC;
```

### Issue Rate
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN has_issue THEN 1 END) as issues,
  COUNT(*) as total_orders,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN has_issue THEN 1 END)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as issue_rate_percent
FROM orders
WHERE delivery_status = 'delivered';
```

### Recent Issues
```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE has_issue = true
  AND issue_reported_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
