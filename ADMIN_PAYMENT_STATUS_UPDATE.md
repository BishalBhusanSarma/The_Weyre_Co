# Admin Payment Status Management

## ✅ Feature Added

### Payment Status Dropdown in Admin Orders
**Location:** Admin Orders Page (`/admin/orders`)

Admins can now update payment status directly from the dashboard with two options:
- **Paid** - Payment confirmed via gateway
- **Refunded** - Order returned, refund processed

## 🎯 Why This Change?

### Previous System

- Only showed "pending" or "paid"

- Had to update database manually

### New System
- ✅ Payment status dropdown in admin panel
- ✅ Two clear options: Paid / Refunded
- ✅ Easy to update when processing returns
- ✅ No database access needed
- ✅ Instant updates
