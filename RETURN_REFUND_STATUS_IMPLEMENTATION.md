# Return/Refund Status Implementation

## ✅ What Changed

### 1. **New Delivery Status: "return_refund"**
Added as a proper database status alongside:
- `pending`
- `shipped`
- `delivered`
- `cancelled`
- **`return_refund`** ← NEW

---

## 🔄 Key Changes

### 1. **Admin Orders Dropdown**
**Location:** `wc/app/admin/orders/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
<option value="pending">Pending</option>
<option value="shipped">Shipped</option>
<option value="delivered">Delivered</option>
<option value="cancelled">Cancelled</option>
```

**After:**
```typescript
<option value="pending">Pending</option>
<option value="shipped">Shipped</option>
<option value="delivered">Delivered</option>
<option value="cancelled">Cancelled</option>
<option value="return_refund">Return/Refund</option>  ← NEW
```

---

### 2. **Customer Order Cancellation**
**Location:** `wc/app/orders/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
delivery_status: 'cancelled',
payment_status: 'refunded'
```

**After:**
```typescript
delivery_status: 'return_refund',  ← Changed from 'cancelled'
payment_status: 'refunded'
```

**Result:** When customers cancel orders, they're now saved to database with `return_refund` status instead of `cancelled`.

---

### 3. **Filter Logic Simplified**
**Location:** `wc/app/admin/orders/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
if (statusFilter === 'return_refund') {
    // Show orders with refunded payment OR cancelled delivery
    filtered = filtered.filter(order =>
        order.payment_status === 'refunded' || 
        order.delivery_status === 'cancelled'
    )
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Simple direct filter - return_refund is now a real status
filtered = filtered.filter(order => 
    order.delivery_status === statusFilter
)
```

**Benefit:** Cleaner code, faster filtering, proper database structure.

---

### 4. **Status Colors Updated**

#### Admin Orders
```typescript
case 'return_refund': return 'bg-purple-900 text-purple-300'
```

#### Customer Orders
```typescript
case 'return_refund': return 'text-purple-400'
```

**Visual:** Purple color for Return/Refund status across the site.

---

### 5. **Customer Order Display**
**Location:** `wc/app/orders/page.tsx`

Added display text for return_refund status:
```typescript
{order.delivery_status === 'return_refund' && 'Return/Refund Processing'}
```

---

## 📊 Status Flow

### Old Flow (Before)
```
Customer cancels order
    ↓
delivery_status = 'cancelled'
payment_status = 'refunded'
    ↓
Filter shows in both "Cancelled" and "Return/Refund" tabs
    ↓
Confusing and inconsistent
```

### New Flow (After)
```
Customer cancels order
    ↓
delivery_status = 'return_refund'
payment_status = 'refunded'
    ↓
Filter shows only in "Return/Refund" tab
    ↓
Clear and consistent
```

## 🎯 Status Definitions

## 🔧 Database Migration

### SQL Script
**File:** `add_return_refund_status.sql`

**What it does:**
1. Updates existing cancelled+refunded orders to `return_refund`
2. Verifies the changes
3. Shows return/refund orders

**Run in Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
UPDATE orders 
SET delivery_status = 'return_refund'
WHERE delivery_status = 'cancelled' 
  AND payment_status = 'refunded';
```

---

## 📱 User Experience
