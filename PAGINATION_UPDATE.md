# Pagination Update - Show More Functionality

## Changes Implemented

### All Products, Men's, and Women's Collection Pages

All three pages now have consistent pagination behavior:

#### Initial Display
- **20 products** shown on page load
- Clean grid layout (4 columns on desktop)

#### Show More Button
- Appears when there are more than 20 products
- Loads **12 additional products** per click
- Button text: "Show More"
- Styled with white background and black text
- Smooth transition on hover

#### Implementation Details

1. **State Management**
   - Added `displayedProducts` state (initial value: 20)
   - Resets to 20 when category filter changes

2. **Product Loading**
   - Loads ALL products from database
   - Uses `.slice(0, displayedProducts)` to control display
   - More efficient than multiple database queries

3. **Show More Logic**
   ```typescript
   onClick={() => setDisplayedProducts(prev => prev + 12)}
   ```
   - Increments by 12 each time
   - Button only shows when `products.length > displayedProducts`

### Files Updated
- ✅ `app/products/page.tsx` - All Products page
- ✅ `app/products/men/page.tsx` - Men's Collection
- ✅ `app/products/women/page.tsx` - Women's Collection

### User Experience
1. User lands on page → sees 20 products
2. Scrolls down → sees "Show More" button
3. Clicks button → 12 more products appear
4. Repeats until all products are shown
5. Button disappears when all products are visible

### Benefits
- ✅ Faster initial page load (only renders 20 products)
- ✅ Better performance with large product catalogs
- ✅ Smooth user experience
- ✅ Consistent across all product pages
- ✅ Works with category filters

### Testing
To test the functionality:
1. Run the `add_100_products.sql` script to add 100 products
2. Visit `/products`, `/products/men`, or `/products/women`
3. Verify 20 products show initially
4. Click "Show More" to load 12 more
5. Repeat until all products are visible
6. Verify button disappears when all products shown

### Technical Notes
- No database pagination needed (loads all at once)
- Client-side slicing for display control
- Category filter resets displayed count
- Search functionality maintains same behavior
