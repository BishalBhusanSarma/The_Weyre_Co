## 📱 URLs to Remember

| Buy Now Checkout | `/buynow/[id]/checkout` | Quick checkout |
| Cart | `/cart` | View cart |
| Cart Checkout | `/checkout` | Cart checkout |
| Orders | `/orders` | View orders |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Module not found"
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Buy Now shows cart items
1. Check URL - should be `/buynow/[id]/checkout` not `/checkout`
2. Clear browser cache
3. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

### Checkout page is blank
1. Check you're logged in
2. Check cart has items (for cart checkout)
3. Check product exists (for buy now)
4. Check browser console for errors

### Quantity not saving
1. Check localStorage in browser DevTools
2. Clear localStorage
3. Try again
