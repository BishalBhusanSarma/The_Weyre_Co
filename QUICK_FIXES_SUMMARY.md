# Quick Fixes Summary

## âœ… 1. Out of Stock Items Auto-Removed from Cart

**What:** Products that go out of stock after being added to cart are now automatically removed when the cart loads.

**How:** 
- Cart checks stock status on load
- Removes out of stock items from database
- Shows alert to user (e.g., "1 out of stock item was removed from your cart.")
- Only displays in-stock items

**File:** `wc/app/cart/page.tsx`

- Discount: `text-green-400` (was green-600)
- Edit button: `text-blue-400` (was blue-600)
- Delete button: `text-red-400` (was red-600)
