// Checkout & Buy Now
<div className="flex justify-between text-green-400 font-medium">
    <span>Delivery Discount</span>
    <span>-₹{DELIVERY_CHARGE.toFixed(2)}</span>
</div>

// Invoice
<div className="flex justify-between py-1 text-sm text-green-600 font-semibold">
    <span>Delivery Discount:</span>
    <span>-₹{(order.delivery_charge || 80).toFixed(2)}</span>
