## 2. Product Detail Page Gap Fix

### Issue:
Large gap between "Back to Products" button and product content

### Root Cause:
- Back button had `mb-8` (margin-bottom: 2rem)
- Product grid had `mt-8` (margin-top: 2rem)
- Combined spacing created 4rem (64px) gap

### Solution:
**File**: `wc/app/products/[id]/page.tsx`

Changed:
```tsx
<Link href="/products" className="text-gray-600 hover:text-black mb-8 inline-block">
    ← Back to Products
</Link>

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-12 mt-8">
```

To:
```tsx
<Link href="/products" className="text-gray-600 hover:text-black mb-4 inline-block">
    ← Back to Products
</Link>

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-12">
```

### Changes:
- Reduced back button margin from `mb-8` to `mb-4`
- Removed `mt-8` from product grid
- Total spacing reduced from 64px to 16px

### Result:
- ✅ More compact, professional layout
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy
- ✅ Improved user experience
- ✅ Consistent spacing with other pages

## Admin Page Navigation Structure

All admin pages now follow this consistent pattern:

```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
    <Navbar />
    
    <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-12">
        <div className="mb-8">
            <Link href="/admin" className="text-gray-600 hover:text-black mb-2 inline-block">
                ← Back to Admin
            </Link>
            <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Page Title</h1>
        </div>
        
        {/* Page content */}
    </div>
</div>
```
