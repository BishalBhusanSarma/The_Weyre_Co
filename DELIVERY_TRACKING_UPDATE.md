# Delivery Tracking Update - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Updated the order system to show delivery as ₹80 with a -₹80 discount (making it FREE for customers), while properly tracking the ₹80 delivery charge in the database for admin analytics and cost calculations.

## What Changed

### Customer View (Frontend)
Customers now see:
```
Subtotal:           ₹1,600.00
Coupon Discount:    -₹100.00
Delivery Charge:    ₹80.00
Delivery Discount:  -₹80.00
─────────────────────────────
Total Savings:      ₹580.00
Total to Pay:       ₹1,500.00
```

**Net Effect**: Shipping is FREE for customers

### Database Storage
Orders are saved with:
```javascript
{
  total: 1500.00,              // What customer pays
  actual_total: 2080.00,       // Original + delivery (₹2000 + ₹80)
  discount_amount: 580.00,     // All discounts including delivery
  delivery_charge: 80,         // Tracked for admin analytics
  coupon_discount: 100.00      // Coupon only
}
```

### Admin Analytics
The admin dashboard automatically calculates:
```
Total Revenue:          ₹1,500 (what customer paid)
Total Delivery Charges: ₹80    (cost to business)
Net Profit:            ₹1,420  (revenue - delivery costs)
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `wc/app/buynow/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added `DELIVERY_CHARGE = 80` constant
- Updated UI to show delivery charge and discount
- Modified order creation to save delivery_charge: 80
- Updated actual_total to include delivery charge
- Updated discount_amount to include delivery discount

### 2. `wc/app/checkout/page.tsx`
- Added `DELIVERY_CHARGE = 80` constant
- Updated UI to show delivery charge and discount
- Modified order creation to save delivery_charge: 80

### 3. `wc/BUYNOW_UNIFIED_FIX.md`
- Updated documentation to reflect delivery tracking

## Admin Dashboard Integration

The existing `wc/lib/analyticsService.ts` already handles delivery charges correctly:

```typescript
// Calculate total delivery charges from paid orders
export function calculateDeliveryCharges(orders: Order[]): number {
    return orders
        .filter(order => order.payment_status === 'paid')
        .reduce((total, order) => total + (order.delivery_charge || 0), 0)
}

// Net Profit calculation
const netProfit = netSales - totalDeliveryCharges - totalRTOCosts
```

**No changes needed** - the analytics service automatically:
1. Sums up all delivery charges from paid orders
2. Subtracts them from net profit
3. Displays accurate business metrics

## Example Calculation

### Order Details:
- Product Actual Price: ₹1,000 × 2 = ₹2,000
- Product Selling Price: ₹800 × 2 = ₹1,600
- Product Discount: ₹400
- Coupon Discount: ₹100
- Delivery Charge: ₹80
- Delivery Discount: -₹80

### Customer Sees:
