### 4. All Products Page (`app/products/page.tsx`) ⏳

- ✅ wishlistIds & cartIds state added
- ✅ loadWishlist & loadCart functions added
- ⏳ Need to replace product card JSX with ProductCard component

## 📋 REMAINING WORK:

### All Products Page - Replace JSX with ProductCard

Find this code in `app/products/page.tsx` (around line 350-400):

```typescript
{products.map((product) => (
    <div key={product.id} className="group relative">
        <Link href={`/products/${product.id}`} ...>
            // ... lots of JSX
        </Link>
    </div>
))}
```

Replace with:

```typescript
{products.map((product) => (
    <ProductCard
        key={product.id}
        product={product}
        user={user}
        isInWishlist={wishlistIds.has(product.id)}
        isInCart={cartIds.has(product.id)}
        onAddToWishlist={addToWishlist}
        onAddToCart={addToCart}
        onBuyNow={buyNow}
    />
))}
```

Do this for:
1. Main products grid
2. Featured products section (if no results)
3. Trending products section (if no results)

### Product Detail Page (`app/products/[id]/page.tsx`)

Need to:
1. Show dual pricing on main product
2. Use ProductCard for Related Products section
3. Use ProductCard for Trending Products section

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS:

**Pages Using ProductCard:**
- ✅ Homepage - Featured & Trending sections
- ✅ Men's Collection - All products
- ✅ Women's Collection - All products
- ⏳ All Products - Need to replace JSX
- ⏳ Product Detail - Need to add for related/trending

**Features Working:**
- ✅ Dual pricing (actual & selling price)
- ✅ Discount badge (green, auto-calculated)
- ✅ Discount percentage
- ✅ Red wishlist icon if wishlisted
- ✅ Red "Go to Cart" if in cart
- ✅ Buy Now button
- ✅ Add to Cart button
- ✅ Wishlist button

## 🚀 QUICK FIX FOR ALL PRODUCTS PAGE:

Use this bash command to see where product cards are rendered:

```bash
grep -n "group relative" app/products/page.tsx
```

Then replace each instance with ProductCard component.

## ✅ VERIFICATION:

Test these pages:
- [ ] `/` - Homepage shows dual pricing on featured/trending
- [ ] `/products/men` - Shows dual pricing, red icons work
- [ ] `/products/women` - Shows dual pricing, red icons work
- [ ] `/products` - Need to update with ProductCard
- [ ] `/products/[id]` - Need to update related/trending sections
